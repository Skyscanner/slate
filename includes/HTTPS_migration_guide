<h1 id='https-migration-guide'>HTTPS migration guide</h1>
<p>As of April 2020 in order to improve the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/why-is-http-not-secure/">security</a> of our Skyscanner Travel APIs, we&#39;re requiring all partners to <strong>only</strong> use 
the <code>https</code> protocol for making requests to our APIs.</p>
<h2 id='what-is-changing'>What is changing?</h2>
<p>Requests and response bodies will remain the same. The only change is that partners must always use the TLS <code>https</code> protocol for making requests to the APIs.</p>
<h2 id='what-do-you-need-to-do'>What do you need to do?</h2>
<p>Partners should replace all references to the <code>http</code> protocol with <code>https</code> in all usages of our API URLs in your codebases.</p>
<h2 id='what-is-the-deadline-for-migration'>What is the deadline for migration?</h2>
<p>The deadline is <strong>30th April 2020</strong>, but you should migrate as soon as possible to get the benefits of increased security with TLS.</p>
