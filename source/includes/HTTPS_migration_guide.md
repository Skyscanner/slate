#  HTTPS migration guide

As of April 2020 in order to improve the [security](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/why-is-http-not-secure/) of our Skyscanner Travel APIs, we're requiring all partners to **only** use 
the `https` protocol for making requests to our APIs.

## What is changing?

Requests and response bodies will remain the same. The only change is that partners must always use the TLS `https` protocol for making requests to the APIs.

## What do you need to do?

Partners should replace all references to the `http` protocol with `https` in all usages of our API URLs in your codebases.

## What is the deadline for migration?

The deadline is **30th April 2020**, but you should migrate as soon as possible to get the benefits of increased security with TLS.
